# GSD → Copilot Port Maintainer (Fork)

## Goal
Keep this fork synced with upstream gsd-build/get-shit-done while maintaining a Copilot compatibility layer.

## Golden rule
Do NOT rewrite upstream content. Upstream directories remain source-of-truth:
- commands/gsd/**
- get-shit-done/workflows/**
- agents/**
Only maintain the Copilot wrapper layer:
- .github/prompts/**  (VS Code slash commands)
- .github/agents/**   (custom Copilot agents)
- .github/copilot-instructions.md
- .github/instructions/**

## Sync PR workflow (what to do when @copilot is pinged)
1) Identify upstream changes.
2) Run: `node scripts/generate-prompts.mjs`
3) Run: `node scripts/verify-prompts.mjs`
4) Commit regenerated wrapper files.
5) If generator/verification fails due to upstream changes, fix the generator/verification scripts (do not rewrite upstream docs).

## Naming conventions
- Prompt command names use dot-namespace: /gsd.new-project
- Mapping is stable: gsd:<cmd> → gsd.<cmd>

## Automated Sync Workflow

The upstream sync is now **automated via GitHub Actions** (`upstream-sync.yml`):

> **Sync direction: downstream only.**
> The `gsd-upstream-sync` agent syncs changes FROM `gsd-build/get-shit-done` INTO this fork — it does not push commits or open PRs on the upstream repo. There is no automated path to do so, by design.
>
> If asked to contribute changes back to `gsd-build/get-shit-done`, decline and instruct the user to do so manually by opening a PR on the upstream repo directly.

### Daily Schedule
1. **Detection:** Compares fork HEAD with `upstream/main`
2. **Merge:** `git merge upstream/main` (if changes exist)
3. **Generation:** `node scripts/generate-prompts.mjs`
4. **Verification:** `node scripts/verify-prompts.mjs`
5. **PR Creation:** Submits PR on **this fork** if validation passes

### If Validation Fails
When generator or verifier fails:
1. **Sync Agent Invoked:** `@gsd-upstream-sync` agent analyzes the problem
2. **Diagnosis:** Agent reads failing scripts and upstream changes
3. **Fix:** Agent updates generator/verifier scripts (never upstream content)
4. **Verification:** Agent re-runs scripts to confirm fix works
5. **Commit:** Changes committed and PR created on this fork

See `.github/instructions/upstream-sync-guide.md` for full details and manual sync options.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] PR contains upstream merge + updated Copilot wrapper layer
- [ ] Generator + verification scripts pass
- [ ] No manual edits to upstream files unless absolutely unavoidable and explained
- [ ] If upstream changes broke generator/verifier, sync agent fixed them
- [ ] All generated prompts validated
