## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Guide the user through MVP-mode planning for a phase. The command:

1. Prompts for an "As a / I want to / So that" user story (three structured questions)
2. Runs SPIDR splitting check — if the story is too large, walks through Spike/Paths/Interfaces/Data/Rules and offers to split into multiple phases
3. Writes `**Mode:** mvp` and the reformatted `**Goal:**` to the phase's ROADMAP.md section
4. Delegates to `/gsd plan-phase <N>` which auto-detects MVP mode via the roadmap field

Phase 1 of the vertical-mvp-slice PRD shipped the planner-side machinery; this command is the user entry point for it.

<runtime_note>
**Copilot (VS Code):** Use `vscode_askquestions` wherever this workflow calls `AskUserQuestion`. Equivalent API.
</runtime_note>

<context>
Phase number: $ARGUMENTS (required — integer or decimal like `2.1`)

The phase must already exist in ROADMAP.md (created via `/gsd new-project`, `/gsd add-phase`, or `/gsd insert-phase`). This command does not create new phases — it converts an existing phase to MVP mode.
</context>

<process>
Execute the mvp-phase workflow from @./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/mvp-phase.md end-to-end.
Preserve all gates: phase existence, status guard (refuse in_progress/completed), user-story format validation, SPIDR splitting check, ROADMAP write confirmation, plan-phase delegation.
</process>
