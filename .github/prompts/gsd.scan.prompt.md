## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Run a focused codebase scan for a single area, producing targeted documents in `.planning/codebase/`.
Accepts an optional `--focus` flag: `tech`, `arch`, `quality`, `concerns`, or `tech+arch` (default).

Lightweight alternative to `/gsd:map-codebase` — spawns one mapper agent instead of four parallel ones.
