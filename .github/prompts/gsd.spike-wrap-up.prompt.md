## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Curate spike experiment findings and package them into a persistent project skill that Claude
auto-loads in future build conversations. Also writes a summary to `.planning/spikes/` for
project history. Output skill goes to `./.claude/skills/spike-findings-[project]/` (project-local).
</objective>

<execution_context>
- Read file at: ./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/spike-wrap-up.md
- Read file at: ./.claude/get-shit-done/references/ui-brand.md
</execution_context>

<runtime_note>
**Copilot (VS Code):** Use `vscode_askquestions` wherever this workflow calls `AskUserQuestion`.
</runtime_note>

<process>
Execute the spike-wrap-up workflow from @./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/spike-wrap-up.md end-to-end.
Preserve all curation gates (per-spike review, grouping approval, CLAUDE.md routing line).
