## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Analyze the phase dependency graph for the current milestone. For each phase pair, determine if there is a dependency relationship based on:
- File overlap (phases that modify the same files must be ordered)
- Semantic dependencies (a phase that uses an API built by another phase)
- Data flow (a phase that consumes output from another phase)

Then suggest `Depends on` updates to ROADMAP.md.
</objective>

<execution_context>
- Read file at: ./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/analyze-dependencies.md
</execution_context>

<context>
No arguments required. Requires an active milestone with ROADMAP.md.

Run this command BEFORE `/gsd:manager` to fill in missing `Depends on` fields and prevent merge conflicts from unordered parallel execution.
</context>

<process>
Execute the analyze-dependencies workflow from @./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/analyze-dependencies.md end-to-end.
Present dependency suggestions clearly and apply confirmed updates to ROADMAP.md.
</process>
