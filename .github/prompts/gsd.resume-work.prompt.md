## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Restore complete project context and resume work seamlessly from previous session.

Routes to the resume-project workflow which handles:

- STATE.md loading (or reconstruction if missing)
- Checkpoint detection (.continue-here files)
- Incomplete work detection (PLAN without SUMMARY)
- Status presentation
- Context-aware next action routing
  </objective>

<execution_context>
- Read file at: ./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/resume-project.md
</execution_context>

<process>
**Follow the resume-project workflow** from `@./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/resume-project.md`.

The workflow handles all resumption logic including:

1. Project existence verification
2. STATE.md loading or reconstruction
3. Checkpoint and incomplete work detection
4. Visual status presentation
5. Context-aware option offering (checks CONTEXT.md before suggesting plan vs discuss)
6. Routing to appropriate next command
7. Session continuity updates
   </process>
