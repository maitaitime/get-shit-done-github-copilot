## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Capture an idea, task, or issue that surfaces during a GSD session as a structured todo for later work.

Routes to the add-todo workflow which handles:
- Directory structure creation
- Content extraction from arguments or conversation
- Area inference from file paths
- Duplicate detection and resolution
- Todo file creation with frontmatter
- STATE.md updates
- Git commits
</objective>

<execution_context>
- Read file at: ./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/add-todo.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Arguments: $ARGUMENTS (optional todo description)

State is resolved in-workflow via `init todos` and targeted reads.
</context>

<process>
**Follow the add-todo workflow** from `@./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/add-todo.md`.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Directory ensuring
2. Existing area checking
3. Content extraction (arguments or conversation)
4. Area inference
5. Duplicate checking
6. File creation with slug generation
7. STATE.md updates
8. Git commits
</process>
