## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Capture ideas, tasks, notes, and seeds to their appropriate destination in the GSD system.

Mode routing:
- **default** (no flag): Capture as a structured todo for later work → add-todo workflow
- **--note**: Zero-friction idea capture (append/list/promote) → note workflow
- **--backlog**: Add an idea to the backlog parking lot (999.x numbering) → add-backlog workflow
- **--seed**: Capture a forward-looking idea with trigger conditions → plant-seed workflow
- **--list**: List pending todos and select one to work on → check-todos workflow
</objective>

<routing>

| Flag | Destination | Workflow |
|------|-------------|----------|
| (none) | Structured todo in .planning/todos/ | add-todo |
| --note | Timestamped note file, list, or promote | note |
| --backlog | ROADMAP.md backlog section (999.x) | add-backlog |
| --seed | .planning/seeds/SEED-NNN-slug.md | plant-seed |
| --list | Interactive todo browser + action router | check-todos |

</routing>

<context>
Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Parse the first token of $ARGUMENTS:
- If it is `--note`: strip the flag, pass remainder to note workflow
- If it is `--backlog`: strip the flag, pass remainder to add-backlog workflow
- If it is `--seed`: strip the flag, pass remainder to plant-seed workflow
- If it is `--list`: pass remainder (optional area filter) to check-todos workflow
- Otherwise: pass all of $ARGUMENTS to add-todo workflow
</context>

<process>
1. Parse the leading flag (if any) from $ARGUMENTS.
2. Load and execute the appropriate workflow end-to-end based on the routing table above.
3. Preserve all workflow gates from the target workflow (directory structure, duplicate detection, commits, etc.).
</process>
