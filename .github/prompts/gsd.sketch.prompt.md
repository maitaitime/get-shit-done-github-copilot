## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Explore design directions through throwaway HTML mockups before committing to implementation.
Each sketch produces 2-3 variants for comparison. Sketches live in `.planning/sketches/` and
integrate with GSD commit patterns, state tracking, and handoff workflows. Loads spike
findings to ground mockups in real data shapes and validated interaction patterns.

Two modes:
- **Idea mode** (default) — describe a design idea to sketch
- **Frontier mode** (no argument or "frontier") — analyzes existing sketch landscape and proposes consistency and frontier sketches

Does not require `/gsd-new-project` — auto-creates `.planning/sketches/` if needed.

**Copilot (VS Code):** Use `vscode_askquestions` wherever this workflow calls `AskUserQuestion`.

<context>
Design idea: $ARGUMENTS

**Available flags:**
- `--quick` — Skip mood/direction intake, jump straight to decomposition and building. Use when the design direction is already clear.
</context>

<process>
Execute the sketch workflow from @./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/sketch.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (intake, decomposition, target stack research, variant evaluation, MANIFEST updates, commit patterns).
