## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Interactive configuration of GSD's third-party integration surface:
- Search API keys: `brave_search`, `firecrawl`, `exa_search`, and
  the `search_gitignored` toggle
- Code-review CLI routing: `review.models.{claude,codex,gemini,opencode}`
- Agent-skill injection: `agent_skills.<agent-type>`

API keys are stored plaintext in `.planning/config.json` but are masked
(`****<last-4>`) in every piece of interactive output. The workflow never
echoes plaintext to stdout, stderr, or any log.

This command is deliberately distinct from `/gsd-settings` (workflow toggles)
and any `/gsd-settings-advanced` tuning surface. It handles *connectivity*,
not pipeline shape.
</objective>

<execution_context>

<process>
**Follow the settings-integrations workflow** from
`@./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/settings-integrations.md`.

The workflow handles:
1. Resolving `$GSD_CONFIG_PATH` (flat vs workstream)
2. Reading current integration values (masked for display)
3. Section 1 — Search Integrations: Brave / Firecrawl / Exa / search_gitignored
4. Section 2 — Review CLI Routing: review.models.{claude,codex,gemini,opencode}
5. Section 3 — Agent Skills Injection: agent_skills.<agent-type>
6. Writing values via `gsd-sdk query config-set` (which merges, preserving
   unrelated keys)
7. Masked confirmation display
</process>
