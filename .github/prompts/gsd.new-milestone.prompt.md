## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Start a new milestone: questioning → research (optional) → requirements → roadmap.

Brownfield equivalent of new-project. Project exists, PROJECT.md has history. Gathers "what's next", updates PROJECT.md, then runs requirements → roadmap cycle.

**Creates/Updates:**
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` — updated with new milestone goals
- `.planning/research/` — domain research (optional, NEW features only)
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — scoped requirements for this milestone
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — phase structure (continues numbering)
- `.planning/STATE.md` — reset for new milestone

**After:** `/gsd:plan-phase [N]` to start execution.
</objective>

<context>
Milestone name: $ARGUMENTS (optional - will prompt if not provided)

Project and milestone context files are resolved inside the workflow (`init new-milestone`) and delegated via `<files_to_read>` blocks where subagents are used.
</context>

<process>
Execute the new-milestone workflow from @./.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/new-milestone.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (validation, questioning, research, requirements, roadmap approval, commits).
