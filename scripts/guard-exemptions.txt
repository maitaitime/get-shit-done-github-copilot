# guard-exemptions.txt — Files this fork intentionally diverges from upstream.
#
# The repair agent guard (guard-upstream-files.sh) treats all files present in
# upstream/main as "upstream-owned" and fails on any commit that modifies them.
# Files listed here are EXCLUDED from that check because the fork deliberately
# overrides them for its own identity, audience, or configuration.
#
# Rules:
#   - One path per line (relative to repo root, no leading slash)
#   - Lines starting with # are comments
#   - Only add files here when the fork intentionally and permanently diverges
#   - If a file is temporarily diverged (e.g. mid-PR sync), do NOT add it here
#
# Files intentionally owned by this fork:
README.md
.github/CODEOWNERS
AGENTS.md

# Fork-owned workflows (recursive)
.github/workflows/**
